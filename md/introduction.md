I'm a 28 year old Dane living in Copenhagen. I love coding, sailing, music & sports.

My current employer is [Maersk](https://www.maersk.com/) and previous employers include [GreenMobility](https://www.greenmobility.com/) and [Mouseflow](https://mouseflow.com/).

My favorites languages are `TypeScript` and `C#`. If you'd like to collaborate on a project, let me know.
