I'm a 28 year old Dane living in Copenhagen. I love coding, sailing, music & sports.

My current employer is <a href="https://www.maersk.com" target="_blank">Maersk</a> and previous employers include <a href="https://www.greenmobility.com" target="_blank">GreenMobility</a> and <a href="https://mouseflow.com" target="_blank">Mouseflow</a>.

My favorites languages are `TypeScript` and `C#`. I'm currently learning `Go`, which I find to be an interesting language.

If you'd like to collaborate on a project, let me know.
