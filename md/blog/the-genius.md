<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Miles Davis</a> is a hero of mine. He has inspired me throughout my life and I'd like to talk a bit about Miles and why his music means a whole lot to me.

I invite you to listen to the above tune while you read. It's actually not from a Miles album but rather from an album called Something Else created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannonball_Adderley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">"Cannonball" Adderley</a>.

Adderley was part of the legendary jazz group, with Miles Davis as its leader, that recorded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_of_Blue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kind of Blue</a>, an album we're going to talk more about later.

The above tune is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_Leaves_(1945_song)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Autumn Leaves</a>, an incredible composition that has become one of the most recorded jazz standards.

What is so special about this version? Well, lets talk about the essence of jazz, one of its critical components. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_improvisation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Improvisation</a>. 

That is, the ability to express your feelings throughout music in the now. It's an incredibly hard thing to do and even harder to make sound good, have coherence and be dynamic. 

The best improvisers are able to invite the listener on a journey that is both melodically and harmonically inexplicably intriguing. 

Any composition serves as the framework wherein to improvise by providing a melody, a theme and a chord progression but the constraints, or rules, are not set in stone. 

As Miles used to say, `There are no mistakes, only better choice of notes.`
