<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_Corea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Chick Corea</a> is one of my all-time favourites musicians. The amount of pleasure I have derived from his work is insurmountable.

Chick's rendition of `All Blues` (_the video above_) received the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Improvised_Jazz_Solo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Grammy Award for Best Improvised Jazz Solo</a> shortly after he sadly passed away in 2021. The tune itself is written by the magnificent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Miles Davis</a> and first occurred on the legendary album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_of_Blue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kind of Blue</a>.

Chick was a master of combining the harmony and improvisation from jazz with, say, the discipline and precision from classical music or the irresistible rhythmic feel from func - and much more. He never stopped exploring and never seemed to really have a dip in output quality.

The next video is a solo concert in Brussels, Belgium where Chick combines a composer dear to my heart, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gershwin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">George Gershwin</a>, with the classical genius <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mozart</a>.

There's not much to say. It's just timeless, wonderful music.

Lastly, one of his greatest compositions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_(instrumental)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spain</a>, is one of his most loved pieces. There are many great takes. This is one of them.

Rest in Peace Maestro. What a blessing it was to hear you play.
